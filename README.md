Sound player library for use in [OpenBOR](https://github.com/DCurrent/openbor) modules. 

Play sounds with any mix of the following options.

* Location based stereo. As objects move along the X axis, left/right volume channels are adjusted accordingly to convey location realism.
* Location volume. As objects move along the Z axis, volume is adjusted to convey realistic distance.
* Randomization. Play a random sound from one of several group types. For example, *“Male > Attack > Heavy”*, or manually define a set as needed.
